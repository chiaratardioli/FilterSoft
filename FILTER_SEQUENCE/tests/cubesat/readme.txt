How to use the program with the TLE catalog

1) We download the TLE catalog of a few objects
2) We run the program TLE2OE to convert the TLE catalog into orbital elements
3) We run the script allorbits.sh to generate the ephemerides of all the objects considered by using the program SIMPLEC
4) We generate the ephemerides table with all the data
5) We run the program coll_avoid.
