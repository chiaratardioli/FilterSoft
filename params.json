{"name":"Conjunction Assessment Analysis","tagline":"Fortran code to be integraded with OrbFit","body":"### Welcome to Conjunction Assessment Page.\r\nThis is a piece of software to be integrated with the [OrbFit software](http://adams.dm.unipi.it/orbfit/OrbFit/doc/help.html).\r\nIt reads a catalogue of objects and systematically excludes pairs that are not at risk of conjunction. It has been tested with a fictitious population of space debris in Low-Earth orbit and with real data of objects from the NORAD website.\r\n\r\n### Procedures\r\nAfter compiling the source code, go on the test folder and try:\r\n````\r\n$ ./chain_order.sh 0\r\n$ ./filter_sequence.x\r\n````\r\n\r\nIf you want to try the TLE catalogue, try instead:\r\n````\r\n$ ./cubesats_ephemerides.sh\r\n$ ./filter_sequence.x\r\n````\r\n\r\nYou can also have a look at one evolution and its interpolation. Just type:\r\n````\r\n$ ./Utest_table.x\r\n````\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMany contributors, not in GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Reporting bugs\r\nPlease contact me for any bug or problem.","google":"UA-42742458-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
